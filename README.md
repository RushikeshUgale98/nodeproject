FROM node:12.2.0-alpine

This line specifies the base image for the Docker image. It uses the official Node.js image version 12.2.0 based on the Alpine Linux distribution, which is known for being lightweight and minimal.
WORKDIR /app

This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. All subsequent commands will be run in this directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
COPY . .

This copies all the files from the current directory on your host machine to the working directory (/app) inside the container.
RUN npm install

This runs the npm install command inside the container to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file. It's crucial for setting up the environment for the Node.js application.
RUN npm run test

This runs the npm run test command to execute the test scripts defined in the package.json file. This step ensures that your application passes all tests before proceeding.
EXPOSE 8000

This informs Docker that the container will listen on port 8000 at runtime. It doesn't actually publish the port, but it serves as documentation and can be used by orchestration tools to map the port.
CMD ["node","app.js"]

This specifies the command to run when the container starts. Here, it runs node app.js, which typically starts the Node.js application.


Explaiition of Deploymentfile

For Building purpose
Build the Docker image using the docker build command. Replace rushikeshugale98/nodejs with your actual Docker Hub repository and image name.
Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
write deployment yaml file also write service file and used commamd kubectl apply -f deploymentfilename then now you can access application on particular portnumber you have given this yamlfile
